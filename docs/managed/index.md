# Managed Compute

Roboflow offers two managed compute options for deploying models:

- A Serverless API that scales with your use.
- Dedicated Deployments that provide a system provisioned exclusively for your use that runs Inference.

The Serverless API and its infinitely-scalable inference is ideal for processing images.

Dedicated Deployments are ideal when you want dedicated infrastructure that can run foundation models like SAM-2, Florence-2, and CLIP.
