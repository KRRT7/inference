# Next Steps

How that you [have a server running](/install/index.md), you're ready to start building! The easiest
way to prototype is by
[building a prototype with the Roboflow Platform's visual debugger](/workflows/create_and_run.md) but you
can also [build with our Python SDK](/inference_helpers/inference_sdk.md) or
[start by forking an Example project](/workflows/gallery/index.md).

Once you've built [a Workflow](/workflows/about.md) you're happy with, you can
[set it up to run on a video stream](/workflows/video_processing/overview.md).
