To build from scratch:

 - create venv with python 3.12
 - install inference with wanted optionals
 - TODO: run build.sh
 - copy from inference repo inference/inference/landing to ./dist/inference_server/inference/landing (static files needed for webserver)
 - copy from venv site-packages to ./dist/inference_server/site-packages
